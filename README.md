# Simon Game ðŸŽ®

A web-based **Simon Game** where the player must repeat the sequence of colors shown by the computer. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## Features
- Classic Simon Game logic with increasing levels.
- Visual feedback with flashing buttons for both computer and user actions.
- Tracks user input and compares with the generated sequence.
- Game over feedback with score display and automatic reset.
- Clean and responsive design for easy interaction.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Press any key to start the game.
3. Watch the color sequence flash on the buttons.
4. Click the buttons in the same order as the sequence.
5. If you match the sequence, you move to the next level.
6. If you click the wrong button, the game shows **Game Over** and resets.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the game and buttons.
- **CSS**: Styling and button flash animations.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, event handling, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

## How It Works
- `gameSeq` array stores the sequence generated by the computer.
- `userSeq` array stores the sequence clicked by the user.
- Functions:
  - `levelup()` â†’ adds a new color and increases the level.
  - `gameFlash(btn)` â†’ flashes computerâ€™s chosen button.
  - `userFlash(btn)` â†’ flashes button clicked by the user.
  - `checkAns(idx)` â†’ checks if user input matches the sequence.
  - `reset()` â†’ resets the game on wrong input.
